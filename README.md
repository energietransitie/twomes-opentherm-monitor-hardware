# Twomes OpenTherm Monitor Shield hardware

This repository contains the open hardware design files for the Twomes OpenTherm Monitor device, consisting of:
* a Twomes OpenTherm Monitor Shield with a [WeMos D1 Mini shield](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1_mini_shield/index.html) form factor, to be placed on;
* a WeMos D1 Mini board, such as the [LilyGO TTGO T7 Mini32 V1.3 ESP32](https://github.com/LilyGO/ESP32-MINI-32-V1.3). 

The OpenTherm Monitor Shield is connected via one wire pair to a [boiler that supports OpenTherm](https://www.otgw.tclcode.com/matrix.cgi#boilers) and via another wire pair to a [thermostat that supports OpenTherm](https://www.otgw.tclcode.com/matrix.cgi#thermostats). The Twomes OpenTherm Monitor can upload this measurement data to a Twomes server via Wi-Fi using secure HTTPS.

N.B. This is device  is NOT an OpenTherm gateway; it only monitors OpenTherm traffic and it cannot insert OpenTherm commands to the boiler or thermostat.

## General info
This repository contains the open hardware designs files for the Twomes OpenTherm Monitor device, It also includes a `docs` folder with recent printouts of the [schematics](./docs/twomes-opentherm-monitor-hardware-sch-v2.0.pdf) and [PCB layout](./docs/twomes-opentherm-monitor-hardware-pcb-v2.0.pdf). 

The associated firmware that you can run on this device can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-opentherm-monitor-firmware).

## Producing

### Printed Ciruit Board
To fabricate the printed circuit board you can use various PCB services. 

The folder [pcb/jlcpcb](./pcb/jlcpcb) includes all exported files needed to have the PCBs manufactured by [JLCPCB](https://www.jlcpcb.com). Upload the [zipped gerber files](./pcb/jlcpcb/gerber/gerber-OpenThermMonitorTwomes.zip) to the [JLCPCB quote page](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote), select the amount of PCBs and a colour for the silkscreen. All other options can be left on default. If SMT assembly is desired, also select this option before ordering. This will take you to a page where the BOM and POS file can be uploaded. Use the files [BOM-TwomesGateway.csv](./pcb/jlcpcb/assembly/BOM-Twomes-OpenTherm-Monitor.csv) and [CPL-TwomesGateway.csv](./pcb/jlcpcb/assembly/CPL-Twomes-OpenTherm-Monitor.csv).

N.B. All components marked "DO NOT PLACE" in the BOM-*.csv file can not be ordered from JLCPCB and need to be ordered from other services and placed manually.

### Enclosure
To fabricate the enclosure you can use your own 3D printer or use a 3D printing service.

The folder [enclosure/fabrication](./enclosure/fabrication) contains exported STL files for the [case](./enclosure/fabrication/twomes-opentherm-monitor-enclosure-case.stl) and [lid](./enclosure/twomes-opentherm-monitor-enclosure-lid.step) of the Twomes OpenTherm Monitor. The STL files can be imported into any slicer and turned into G-Code for a 3D printer.

## Developing

### Printed Circuit Board
To change the hardware design of the PCB, you need:
* [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/download/) installed to change te PCB design. 

The KiCad source files of the PCB can be found in the folder [pcb](./pcb).

To convert the PCBs into a format suitable for fabrication, consult the webpage of your PCB manufacturer of choice. For example, see the [JLCPCB guide on how to export Gerbers](https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/149-how-to-generate-gerber-and-drill-files-in-kicad) and the  [JLCPCB guide how to export the BOM and POS files](https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/84-how-to-generate-the-bom-and-centroid-file-from-kicad). You may also use a KiCad plug-in for this purpose such as [kicad-jlcpcb-tools](https://github.com/Bouni/kicad-jlcpcb-tools).

### Enclosure
To change the hardware design of the enclosure, you need either:
* [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.kicad.org/download/) installed (Autodesk provides 30 day free trials and [free one-year educational access](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual) to its products and services for eligible students, teachers and research staff); 
* or [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/), an open source alternative.

The source files of the enclosure can be found in the folder [enclosure](./enclosure). We include both .f3d source files and .step source files we obtained after conversion.

## Features
The Twomes OpenTherm Monitor is a [WeMos D1 Mini shield](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1_mini_shield/index.html) that features the following main hardware components:
* 2 screw pluggable terminal blocks, each with two positions (OpenTherm communication between thermostat and boiler is passed through even if the [LilyGO TTGO T7 Mini32 V1.3 ESP32](https://github.com/LilyGO/ESP32-MINI-32-V1.3) board receives no power via its micro USB port or has crashed);
* recessed Wi-Fi reset button for use behind a pinhole in the device enclosure.

To-do:
* document which screw-click connectors we used;
* change design and JLCPCB files to take advantage of the new [hand-soldering option for through-hole parts](https://jlcpcb.com/smt-assembly).
