## General info
This repository will soon contain firmware files and open hardware design files (e.g. schematics and board layout files) for the Twomes OpenTherm onotir device. Initially, the firmware will be developed as a branch for the [Twomes OpenTherm DIYLESS gateway](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-opentherm-gateway-diyless) firmware, until it is ripe for its own repository. Meanwhile, schematics and board layout files and instructions how to order SMD assembled versions may already appear in this repository.

## Prerequisites
Describe which (hardware and) software you need before you can deploy the software or develop with the source code. If the prerequisites are different for deploying users and developing users, you may want to move the prerequisites section as a subsection of each of those sections.

## Deploying
Describe how the reader can download and install the lastest installable version(s). If appropriate, link to the latest binary release or package you published in the repo. If needed, describe this for different platforms.
Use steps if the procedure is non-trivial:
1. first step;
2. second step;
3. final step.

Format any scripts or commands in a way that makes them  easy to copy, like the following example. 

Forgotten your Wi-Fi password? No problem with the follwing command, replacing `SSID` with the Wi-Fi name of your own Wi-Fi network: 
```shell
netsh wlan show profile SSID key=clear
```

## Developing
Describe how the reader can use / adapt/ compile the souce code. 

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development. Ready:

* awesome feature 1;
